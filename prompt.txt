now assume that I am going to use this prompt
with Claude CLI - I want to work in a directory
aaos where Claude remembers always the last
status - so that I will version it on GitHub and can
use in different machines. Whenever I use a new
laptop, Claude will remember the context of all
questions/ answers from previous interactions
and will save tokens from it. If I well remember, I
can use something like 'Claude init' command to
setup this environment. Also create an agent that
will be called whenever I want to finish my daily
studies - this agent will take care of reviewing
README.md file containing all instructions
(learning information) and will rewrite to better
reusability and easy understanding of the
instructions in following days. Besides that, there
will be another agent in charge of committing the
latest code and pushing it to my GitHub repository.
Additionally, I want the prompt to create other agents that will make my work very efficient and
productive, always saving tokens to not become too expensive. All these agents should be
course agnostic, in other words, I should be able to create any course learning path by simply
providing a topic in a configuration file (course.config), which will be used for the training - e.g. If
after learning the AAOS I want to focus on Figma, then I would just manually update
course.config with Topic2=Figma and run an agent to prepare a full course for me on The topic.
Each course should not take longer than 1 week to complete (considering 8h a day) -
After one month of training, I want to be able to cover 4 topics within this industry to have a
more in depth understanding of the engineering behind so I can better understand the efforts
required to deliver any Infotainment project based on android for any OEM or Tier-1 supplier. My
idea is to act as a freelancer consultant to support OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers building the next-
generation infotainment system.
Here is your enhanced prompt specifically optimized for Claude CLI / Claude Code. It
incorporates persistent context via ~/aaos/ repo, CLAUDE.md for memory, custom
sub‑agents (which Claude Code natively supports via ./agents/ and ~/.claude/agents/), GitHub
integration, course.config, and token‑efficient workflows. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
This prompt will have Claude CLI create the full self‑contained system in ~/aaos/, which you git
init, push to GitHub, and clone anywhere.

Prompt for Claude CLI: Setup my AAOS Learning Lab with persistent agents + GitHub sync
You are an expert Claude Code CLI engineer building a persistent, token‑efficient learning lab
for me in ~/aaos/ directory. This will be my always‑on AAOS dev environment that remembers
everything across machines via GitHub.

Core Requirements
 1. Initialize the ~/aaos/ repo structure (do this first if not exists):
      mkdir -p ~/aaos/{source,docs,agents,scripts,courses}
      cd ~/aaos
      git init


        Create CLAUDE.md (persistent project context Claude Code automatically reads). [2] [4]
        Create course.config (YAML/JSON):
              current_topic: "AAOS Platform Build & Upgrades"
              topics:
                - topic1: "AAOS Platform Build & Upgrades" # week 1
                - topic2: "Figma → AAOS HMI/UX"              # week 2
                - topic3: "AAOS Cloud/Connectivity"         # week 3
                - topic4: "AAOS OTA & Security"             # week 4
              weekly_hours: 40 # 8h/day x 5


        Commit everything to main and set up GitHub remote (ask me for repo name if needed).
        [1]

 2. Day‑1 AAOS build setup (Linux desktop, hands‑on from hour 1):
        Step‑by‑step commands to install deps, repo sync AAOS 14/15, build car emulator
        image, boot it. [6] [7] [8]
        Store AAOS source in ~/aaos/source/ and build artifacts in ~/aaos/source/out/.
        Create scripts in ~/aaos/scripts/ for common tasks: build.sh, emulator.sh, upgrade-
        test.sh.

 3. Custom Sub‑Agents system (create in ./agents/ and ~/.claude/agents/):
    Claude Code will auto‑discover and use these via /agents slash commands. Make them
    token‑efficient (scoped context, summaries). [3] [5]
    Required agents (create YAML/MD files for each):
        daily-review: Reviews ~/aaos/README.md, rewrites it for clarity/reusability, summarizes
        today's progress, plans tomorrow. Trigger: claude /agents daily-review.
       git-sync: Commits changes (git add . && git commit -m "Daily progress:
       [auto‑summary]" && git push), creates PRs if needed. Trigger: claude /agents git-sync.

       course-planner: Reads course.config, generates/refines 1‑week plan (40h) for current
       topic with daily tasks, resources, hands‑on exercises. Trigger: claude /agents course-
       planner --update.

       aaos-mentor: Core AAOS expert for builds, upgrades, changes (e.g., "explain VHAL
       change in AAOS 15"). Scoped to ~/aaos/source/.
       upgrade-diff: Analyzes diffs between AAOS versions, generates checklists/migrations.

       token-guard: Monitors session token use, suggests summaries, prunes context if >80%
       limit.
   Make agents course‑agnostic: Use course.config current_topic to specialize (e.g., for
   "Figma": generate Figma‑to‑code workflows). New topic = edit config + course-planner --
   update. [5] [3]

 4. Persistent memory & token efficiency:
       Use CLAUDE.md + ./agents/*.md for context (Claude Code reads automatically). [4] [2]
       Session persistence: Use claude --continue / --resume in ~/aaos/. Hidden .claude/ dir
       for history. [9] [10]
       Daily ritual: claude /agents daily-review → claude /agents git-sync. Saves full context
       to GitHub.
       On new machine: git clone <github> ~/aaos && cd ~/aaos && claude --continue
       (inherits everything). [1]
 5. Hands‑on 1‑week AAOS plan (update README.md):
       Day 1: Build + emulator.
       Days 2–3: Modify services/HMI.
       Days 4–5: Simulate AAOS 14→15 upgrade.
       Use agents throughout (e.g., /agents aaos-mentor "add logging to CarService"). [11] [12]
 6. IDE Integration:
       Recommend VS Code + Claude Code extension (industry standard for AAOS/AOSP
       work: fast, Git‑native, terminal‑heavy). [13] [14] [15]
       Steps: Install VS Code, Claude Code extension, open ~/aaos/, use integrated terminal
       for claude commands.
       Fallback: Android Studio for emulator/app debugging.

Output Format

 ## 🚀 QUICK START (copy‑paste these 5 commands)
 $ mkdir -p ~/aaos && cd ~/aaos
 $ [commands...]

 ## 📁 Repo Structure
Then sections for: Setup, Agents (with trigger commands), Daily Workflow, Week 1 Plan, Token
Tips.
Generate all files/scripts/agents now and show exact contents. End with: "Run claude /agents
git-sync to push to GitHub."


Paste this exactly into Claude CLI in a fresh ~/aaos/ dir (or let it create it). It will bootstrap
everything: files, agents, GitHub setup, and your first AAOS build plan.
After setup, your daily flow:
 1. cd ~/aaos && claude --continue
 2. Work + /agents aaos-mentor etc.
 3. End day: /agents daily-review → /agents git-sync
For new topics: Edit course.config, /agents course-planner --update, repeat.
This covers your 4 topics in 1 month and positions you perfectly as an infotainment consultant.
Ready to run it—what's your GitHub repo name for ~/aaos/?
